/**
 * AICPU Dispatcher — transient bootstrap-only upload helper.
 *
 * Architecture
 * ============
 *
 * This dispatcher SO has one job: write the bundled runtime SO bytes to the
 * main aicpu_scheduler's preinstall path. It is **never** written to disk
 * itself and **never** dispatches at per-task launch time.
 *
 * Bootstrap flow (host → libaicpu_extend_kernels → dispatcher → preinstall):
 *
 *   1. host calls `rtAicpuKernelLaunchExWithArgs` (kernel_type =
 *      `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_KFC`) targeting libaicpu_extend_kernels with
 *      DeviceArgs containing:
 *        - aicpu_so_bin / aicpu_so_len  → dispatcher SO bytes (libaicpu_extend_kernels reads)
 *        - inner_so_bin / inner_so_len  → runtime SO bytes    (dispatcher reads)
 *   2. libaicpu_extend_kernels writes the dispatcher bytes to its own private
 *      path (some /tmp on device, often unlinked after open), dlopens us,
 *      dlsym's the three CANN-contract symbols (Static + DynInit + Dyn),
 *      invokes our `DynTileFwkBackendKernelServerInit`.
 *   3. Our Init reads inner_so_bin/inner_so_len from DeviceArgs, fingerprints
 *      the bytes (FNV-1a over first 64 bytes XOR len), and writes them to
 *      `/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/0/aicpu_kernels_device/simpler_inner_<fp>.so`.
 *      The sched thread (HwHiAiUser) owns this dir, so the write succeeds.
 *   4. host computes the same fingerprint locally to derive the same
 *      preinstall filename.
 *   5. Per-task launches: host calls `rtAicpuKernelLaunchExWithArgs`
 *      (kernel_type = `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU`, so_name = `simpler_inner_<fp>.so`,
 *      kernel_name = `simpler_aicpu_init`/`_exec`). The main aicpu_scheduler
 *      dlopens the preinstall file once and caches the handle; dispatcher is
 *      no longer in the picture.
 *
 * Multi-runtime in one host process: each DeviceRunner bootstraps with the
 * same dispatcher bytes + its own runtime SO bytes. A process-level
 * fingerprint cache in LoadAicpuOp short-circuits repeat invocations for
 * the same runtime SO content, so libaicpu_extend_kernels' one-shot
 * `firstCreatSo_` latch fires at most once per (process, fingerprint).
