/**
 * Scheduler — DAG scheduling engine.
 *
 * The Scheduler thread routes tasks through the DAG lifecycle:
 *   ready_queue → dispatch (via WorkerManager) → completion → fanout release → new ready
 *
 * Worker pool management (WorkerThread creation and dispatch) is delegated to
 * WorkerManager. NEXT_LEVEL placement is fixed at submit; SUB remains free.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   Orch: submit() → directed NEXT_LEVEL queue or shared SUB queue + notify
 *
 *   Scheduler thread:
 *     wait on cv (ready queue OR completion queue OR stop requested)
 *     drain completion_queue → on_task_complete → fanout release → ready_queue
 *     launch directed NEXT_LEVEL tasks, then freely scheduled SUB tasks
 *
 *   WorkerThread (managed by WorkerManager):
 *     loop: task_queue.pop() → endpoint.run(dispatch) →
 *           completion callback → Scheduler.worker_done(completion)
